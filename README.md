# Personal-projects
This repository contains personal projects, such as Websites or Desktop Application. I will explain in short what is all about with every application:

1. Chess (Player)
      The Chess application is like a music player, but this time using chess pieces. The user selects a file from his computer with algebraic notations and load the
   file into the application. After that The user can execute a certain move, can start a timer-based player, can reset the game or can go back with the moves.
      The application is constructed using C#/WPF and MVVM pattern. The four principles of OOP can be seen especially when creating each chess piece and validating 
   their moves. The main purpose of this application was to apply OOP principles. The application also have the posibility to connect two different machines using 
   sockets, such that, a machine (the server) cand move pieces remotely on another machine (the client).
      To test this application, simply download the code, start the application, load the provided files with the algebraic notation moves, and start the player.
      
2. FinanceDashboard
      The FinanceDashboard has not logic behind (yet), it has only a part of GUI and the corresponding Binding Context (MVVM). This is made for the purpose of getting 
   comfortable with animations, graphs, styles, custom user controls, etc.
   
3. YelpCamp
      The YelpCamp webiste, is the result of a previous WebDeveloperBootcamp. The main purpose of this application is to train CRUD functionalities. The user can
   authenticate on the website, can create new campgrounds, can update, delete, can leave a review, and can see all campgrounds available on the world map.
   The applications has at its base JS, HTML, CSS, Node.js for the background work, Cloud functionalities to store images for campgrounds, DBs for storing all campground
   informations, all the user informations and the corresponding reviews for each campground.
   
4. Wellness Website 
      The Wellness Webiste app is my Bachelor's Degree Diploma project. The main purpose of this is to help people understand more about nutrition, to help them create
   healthy plates, to track progess, to have the possiblity to ask for help (live chat), subscription (Stripe.js), to create a profile and many more. The application
   has more or less the same frameworks used in the previous project (YelpCamp).

PS: Each project has a short video presentation.
